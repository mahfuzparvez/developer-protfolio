            <p class="p1">Assalamualaikum to everyone. I am a Muslim. The literal meaning of the word Islam is ‘peace’.
                It
                is a religion that was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) over fourteen hundred years ago in Saudi
                Arabia.
                As per Muslim beliefs, Islam is the last religion that Allah Almighty has sent for the guidance of
                mankind
                and there wont be any other religion following it. Moreover, Islam is not just a religion that gives
                only
                the religious way of life, rather it is complete code of life and speaks about every matter of life,
                whether
                it is economics, politics, or social life and so on.</p>
